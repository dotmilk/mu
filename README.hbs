A few frills anti-framework for use in electron, no thought or care has been given to any other
environment or use case.

Api of models and views and such inspired by [ampersand.js](https://ampersandjs.com/).

The statemachine is somewhat based on the api of [machina.js](http://machina-js.org/).

To take a look at some of the core stuff and some hot widget action
```
npm i
npm run examples
```

Then stroll on over to chrome / chromium and take a look.
